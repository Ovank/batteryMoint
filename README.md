# :battery: BatteryMoint

I developed this personal project driven by a practical needâ€”often forgetting to unplug my laptop charger once the battery is fully charged. This oversight leads to battery degradation, resulting in unnecessary expenses for replacing the laptop battery. By creating this project, I aim to address this issue and ensure optimal battery management to prolong its lifespan and save costs effectively.
